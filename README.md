# imdb-reviews

Dataset: ‘IMDB dataset’

 

Task 1: Exercise (Python Jupyter notebook)

                - Preprocessing

                                - Remove non-digit and non-letter parts

                                - Remove stop words (but keep the word 'from')

                                - Remove standalone numbers (remove '100' from '100 pieces')

                                - Any other text cleaning and standard processing

               

                - Objectives

                                - EDA

                                - Build a classifier

                                                - Target variable is 'sentiment', build a classifier and assess its performance

                                - Anomaly detection on 'review' (ignore 'sentiment' column)

                                                - Create a model to detect outliers/anomalies in this dataset

                                                - Describe what are the anomalous rows and why were they detected as anomaly (which factors influenced)

 

Task 2: Create slides (up to 7 slides)

                - Explain technical approach in task 1,  briefly describe techniques and packages used

                - If unable to solve both objectives, explain what would be the next steps to do so

                - Results and conclusions
